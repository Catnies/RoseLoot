# RoseLoot README

Thanks for downloading RoseLoot!

This plugin has some fairly advanced configuration files, and as such it will be required for you to read through the
wiki in order to fully grasp all the concepts.

You can find some examples of how to use RoseLoot within the examples folder in the same directory as this README file.
Any loot table files that are in the examples folder will be ignored by RoseLoot. If you would like to execute them,
simply put them in the same directory as this README file.

Happy configuring!
